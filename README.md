# co-lab

Co-Lab is a music collaboration site. Being a musician (at a stretch) myself, I wanted a social media platform based around the idea of sharing music with like-minded people. 

The site is still conceptual and being regularly worked on but the idea is to allow users to upload clips of music they are working on (singing, melodies, guitar riffs, edm drops, hip hop loops etc) and have interested users reach out for collaboration opportunities. Users will be able to download, add their own twist and reupload while giving credit to the original uploader.
